This is the Project 2 for Data Analytics and Visualisation.

For now the repo will be structured as follows:

main
|
--- Proposal.docx -> Contains the project proposal.
|
--- Data -> This is where we will store the data used for the Project.
|
--- Problem_Code.Rmd -> This file includes all the coding part of the project

Note: This structure might change as we move forward with project.
